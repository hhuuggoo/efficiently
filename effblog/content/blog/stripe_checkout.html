Efficiently is a site for creating [shareable online outlines](https://eff.iciently.com/login).  I use it every day
because breaking my work into [tasks](https://eff.iciently.com/login) and [subtasks](https://eff.iciently.com/login)
makes me much more productive.  I've been working on Efficently in my spare time for a few years now, it started as a tool for my own personal use, however now that it's relatively mature, I wanted to spend some minimal effort to see if I could monetize it. I've used stripe before, and always loved it's easy to use API.
In the past I've always written my own forms but writing the input validation for credit card forms can be quite a pain.  I was thrilled when I saw that stripe now has their [own credit card forms](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout)  that you can use easily from your application.

<h3 class="heading"> Adding a payment widget </h3>

The first thing I wanted to do, was add an upgrade form in the main user interface to make it easy for people to upgrade their accounts.

<br>

![]({{ media_url('images/effpaymentnavbar.png') }})

<br>

Clicking on the Upgrade button pops up a modal dialog where the user can input their credit card information.  Stripe handles all input validation and displays nice error messages if there are problems with any of the inputs.

<br>

![]({{ media_url('images/effmodalpayment.png') }})

<br>

After entering valid credit card information, The user is upgraded!

<h3 class="heading"> How does it work? </h3>

1.  You add stripe's payment button into a form on your page
2.  When the user completes stripe's dialog, that button is converted
  into a hidden input in your form with the stripe token
3.  Stripe also submits your form for you, using the url you have in your `/action`
  attribute
4.  Your server needs to have the normal stripe code for making the appropriate
charges with that stripe token.

Here is the html for adding the payment widget into my page.

{% syntax html %}
<form class="form-inline inlineupgrade" 
      action="/settings/upgrade" method="POST">
  <select class="input-small" name="optionsplan">
    <option value="monthly">$5/month</option>
    <option value="yearly">$20/year</option>
  </select>
  <input type="hidden" name="test" value="test"/>
  <script src="https://checkout.stripe.com/v2/checkout.js"
          class="stripe-button"
          data-key="{ { key } }"
          data-panel-label="Upgrade"
          data-label="Upgrade"
          >
  </script>
  <a href="#" id="whyupgrade">Why Upgrade?</a>
</form>
{% endsyntax %}

The relevant snippet is the script tag, which loads `checkout.js`.  The most important functional attribute you need is the data-key, which should be the stripe public key.  Everything else controls the styling of stripe's payment button and credit card dialog.

<h3 class="heading"> Stripe on the server  </h3>

Once the user submits the form, the server needs to look at the stripe token, and 
charge the user.  I'm using python/flask on the server, with mongodb as my storage engine.


When the user completes stripe's payment, I receive an HTTP post with 2 parameters, `stripeToken` and `optionsplan`.  `stripeToken` is injected by stripe by their library, and `optionsplan` is an input that exists inside my html form, since my service 
supports both a monthly and an annual plan. 
The first thing I do, is use stripe to create a stripe user, and store it's ID inside mongo.  You'll notice that I store stripe's customer ID inside my user so that I can join the 2 sets of information later.

{% syntax python %}
user = app.db.user.find_one({'username' : session.get('username')})
customer = stripe_customer(user, create=True)
customer.card = request.values['stripeToken']
customer.save()

def stripe_customer(user, create=False):
    customer = None
    stripe_cust_id = user.get('stripe_customer', None)
    if stripe_cust_id:
        customer = stripe.Customer.retrieve(stripe_cust_id)
    elif create:
        customer = stripe.Customer.create(description=user['username'])
        app.db.user.update(
            {'_id' : user['_id']},
            {'$set' : {'stripe_customer' : customer['id']}},
            safe=True
            )
    return customer

{% endsyntax %}

{%- endmark %}

After setting up the stripe customer, I need to subscribe them to the plan.
Stripe allows you to create plans using their account dashboard.
Before you begin, you should do this, so you know what IDs you should
be using when you subscribe your users.
I have a `set_plan` utility function which will either call
`update_subscription` or `cancel_subscription`, as well as cache in mongo
the `plan_id` that a user is subscribed to.

{% syntax python %}
set_plan(user, plan_id, customer=customer)
def set_plan(user, plan, customer=None):
    if customer is None:
        customer = stripe_customer(user)
    if plan is None:
        customer.cancel_subscription()
        app.db.user.update({'_id' : user['_id']},
                           {'$set' : {'cached_plan' : None,
                                      'stripe_customer' : None}},
                           safe=True)
    else:
        customer.update_subscription(plan=plan)
        app.db.user.update({'_id' : user['_id']},
                           {'$set' : {'cached_plan' : plan}},
                           safe=True)
{% endsyntax %}

You'll notice that I'm storing stripe's plan under the "cached_plan" field
on my user object - this isn't really necessary, in fact in order to minimize 
information duplication, it's probably better to 
just pull that information from stripe.
However, I didn't want to have to hit stripe every time I render the page.
I have a function stripe_plan
which takes advantage of cached_plan, as well as my own override.

{% syntax python %}

def stripe_plan(user):
    if user.get('plan_override'):
        return user.get('plan_override')
    if user.get('cached_plan'):
        return user.get('cached_plan')
    return _stripe_plan(user)

{% endsyntax %}

This allows me to gift subscriptions on my side just by setting a field inside mongo db.

<h3 class="heading"> Using your own buttons  </h3>

The last issue I ran into was using my own buttons with stripe.  I have a form for upgrading plans on the settings page, and since I want all UI elements 
on that page to be consistent, I wanted to use my own buttons rather than stripe's button.
{% syntax js %}
$(function(){
    $('#paybutton').click(function(){
	var token = function(res){
	    var $input = $('<input type=hidden name=stripeToken />').val(res.id);
	    $('.stripeform').append($input).submit();
	};
	StripeCheckout.open({
	    key: key,
	    token: token
	});
	return false;
    });
});
{% endsyntax %}

Step1 - stripe payments.  Step2 - get users.  Step3 - profit!!!

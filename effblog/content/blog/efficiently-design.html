Efficiently is a site for creating [shareable online outlines](https://eff.iciently.com/login).  I use it every day
because breaking my work into [tasks](https://eff.iciently.com/login) and [subtasks](https://eff.iciently.com/login)
makes me much more productive.  You can try the [Efficiently demo](https://eff.iciently.com/docview/r/4ed70c031a7ba32edb000002/).
I've never been good at design - I'm still not, but I wanted to see just how non-terrible I could be.  When I first built 
Efficiently, it was called Yata - Yet Another Task Application.  I like acronyms, and yata.in was a 
domain that was available for cheap.  I built it, set it up, and it was fine... but the design left a little to be desired.
Here is the landing page:

![]({{ media_url('images/yatasplash.png') }})

And the actual application

![]({{ media_url('images/yataoutline.png') }})

So it's certainly not as terrible as it could be, but it wasn't great.  I saw a post on hackernews about [bootstrapping design](http://bootstrappingdesign.com/), which was a way to learn some basics about design for hackers.  It's a great book, a quick read, and is responsible for the way the site looks today.  It was pretty simple, so I wanted to share how anyone can use the simple design tips from [bootstrapping design](http://bootstrappingdesign.com/) to improve their site.

<h3 class="heading"> Typography </h3>

Typography is emphasized in the book, and it's super important.  The 
first thing I did was browse google web fonts and select a few that I liked.
[bootstrapping design](http://bootstrappingdesign.com/) stressed that you
want to use a few fonts, but you don't want to go crazy.  I settled on 3
fonts, Lobster Two for the logo, Open Sans for regular text, and 
Open Sans Condensed for headings.  See for yourself

<center style="font-size:150%">
  <div class="heading">My heading font</div>
  <br>
  <div class="">Regular Text</div>
  <br>
  <div style="font-family:Lobster Two;">Efficiently Logo</div>
</center>

<h3 class="heading"> Choosing a Color Theme </h3>

<center>
  <svg height="100" width="500">
    <rect height="100" width="100" fill="#CDE8FF"/>
    <rect height="100" width="100" x="100" fill="#64B5FF"/>
    <rect height="100" width="100" x="200" fill="#1671D4"/>
    <rect height="100" width="100" x="300" fill="#1E2322"/>
    <rect height="100" width="100" x="400" fill="#0D0D0D"/>	
  </svg>
</center>

I went to a website that had a bunch of color themes, I don't remember which one, but it was pretty easy to select one that I liked.  After selecting it, I
simply used all the color codes in my css.  Efficiently is a very
text heavy site and it's not super colorful, however having a cohesive and
uniform approach to all accent colors is a good idea


<h3 class="heading"> Creating a Logo </h3>

One of the best things pointed out by bootstrapping design, is that you can
get great logos by choosing great fonts!  I went with Lobster Two, and
then created some a simple bullet list using SVG and I was done really
quickly.  I wrote the SVG by hand, but I'm sure there are alot of tools
out there for doing so.  Here is the Logo.
<center>
  <a href="/" style="text-decoration:none">
    <svg class="logo" height="65" width="300">
      <g transform="scale(0.5, 0.5)">
        <svg height="130" width="600">
          <rect height="130" width="600" rx="10" ry="10" class="bgrect"/>
          <g transform='translate(0,90)'>
	        <text font-family="Lobster Two" font-weight="normal" font-size="110" y="5" x="20">
	          Efficiently
	        </text>
          </g>
          <g transform='translate(400,10)'>
	        <g transform="translate(20, 20)">
	          <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="12"/>
	          <rect x="8" y="-4" width="300" height="9" r="12"/>
	        </g>
	        <g transform="translate(50, 52)">
	          <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="12"/>
	          <rect x="8" y="-4" width="300" height="9" r="12"/>
	        </g>
	        <g transform="translate(50, 85)">
	          <circle cx="0" cy="0" r="12"/>
	          <rect x="8" y="-4" width="300" height="9" r="12"/>
	        </g>
          </g>
        </svg>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </a>

There you have it, a few simple design tips from [bootstrapping design](http://bootstrappingdesign.com/), and my site is looking alot better.  It's worth noting that using less and bootstrap made it alot easier to put this site together, however 
I really think updating your typography, color scheme, and logo can make a
website much better.

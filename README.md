### Efficiently

Efficiently is my adaptation of [emacs org mode for the web](https://eff.iciently.com/login).  It is a site for creating [shareable online outlines](https://eff.iciently.com/login).  I use it every day
because breaking my work into [tasks](https://eff.iciently.com/login) and [subtasks](https://eff.iciently.com/login)
makes me much more productive.  You can try the [Efficiently demo](https://eff.iciently.com/docview/r/4ed70c031a7ba32edb000002/).

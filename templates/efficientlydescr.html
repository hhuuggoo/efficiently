      Click the sharing button in the toolbar.  A dialog will pop up where you can decide who you wish to share your outline with.  You can enter multiple values separated by commas.  The name "all" means that your outline will be public and anyone can view it.  You can give people access to read, as well as access to edit your outline.  Since you can specify people with email addresses, they don't need to have efficiently ahead of time.  If you make a link public, you can share it with anyone just by giving them the URL.  They won't even need to sign up to view your outline.
